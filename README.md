# Trigonofighter: Defend Earth

Hi friends, I had the task of teaching trigonometry to a friend, I wanted to find a nice trig videogame for this person, however, I couldn't find any fun games, so I decided to write my own.

I submit this humbly so I can get some feedback.

## Premise

The premise of the game, is that some asteroids are approaching earth, and we have

to shoot some nukes to the asteroids, however the bases can only shoot upwards, so one must do some Hour Minute Seconds into degree conversion, then later do some angle addition, and then later must convert cartesian coordinates (of the asteroid), using the inverse tangent function, in order to calculate the angle of the thing, and then must wait for the precise moment in seconds, by having the hour/minute/second of the earth be aligned with the asteroid, before firing the nukes.

I think making games in order to teach concepts is a fun activity, and I'm humbly looking for feedback on how to make the game more fun/more educational.
